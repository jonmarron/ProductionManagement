Production Management
A group of highly respected manufacturers want you to model their production management system.

They can own different types of machines:

Dividers, with a maximum workload of 30kg

Small Turning Machines, with a maximum workload of 5kg

Big Turning Machines, with a maximum workload of 20kg

Every one of them has a unique identifier, and can have one or more work items inserted into them. A work item can have a weight of 1-10kg. Turning Machines can be Woodworking or Metalworking ones.
An operator can run the entire system by executing the work of each machine with their workload. If one or more machines are overloaded, the work for those machines fail, and we need to give the operator the list of these machines. After a machine is successfully finished, its work items are emptied.
